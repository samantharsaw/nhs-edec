              This section primarily relates to the core hours of 8am to 6:30pm every day except weekends and bank holidays. We assume that the practice is providing general medical services to meet the reasonable needs of its patients. When entering opening times outside this window, we assume that this relates to reception hours. This section covers the provision of services, including routine and emergency/out-of-hours medical care.</p>

            <p>All responses to questions in this chapter will also be used to allow the general public to learn more about the practices which provide particular services. This may include the sharing of responses from some questions with public facing NHS websites for example NHS.UK.</p>
