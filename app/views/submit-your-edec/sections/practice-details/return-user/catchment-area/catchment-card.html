            <p>The aim is to use these catchment areas to allow practices and the public to determine whether services can be provided.</p>

            <p>We expect the majority of practices to be able to enter their catchment area using the tool provided.</p>

            <p>Additional functionality has been provided to enable practices to upload a catchment area which has been drawn using an alternative mapping software programme on the proviso the file is in KML point format and successfully uploads.</p>

            <p>Catchment area information could be shared with public facing NHS websites for example NHS.UK.</p>
