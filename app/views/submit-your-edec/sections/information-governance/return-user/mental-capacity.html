There is patch availability of training resource on the MCA, - but with increasing prevalence of dementia, NHS England wants to ensure that practices have access to appropriate training and support. Assessment of capacity is highlighted in BMA’s guidance ‘Safeguarding vulnerable adults – a tool kit for general practitioners. CQC inspectors will want GPs and other practice staff to demonstrate their competence in safeguarding adults at risk. Whilst not a contractual requirement, NHS England is keen to ensure all practices have access to the required level of support to ensure that practices are aware of good practice in relation to adult safeguarding and the issues regarding the MCA. The outcome will help to inform future training requirements."
