              NHS England and NHS Improvement, as with all NHS organisations is required to share intelligence with other statutory bodies, both in circumstances where they have a legal right to request it e.g. National Audit Office, CQC; or where it is necessary or expedient for them to receive it in order to protect the welfare of individuals or to discharge their functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practices are therefore reminded of the significance to ensure that responses provided to questions are accurate and can withstand legal scrutiny, the declaration is treated and considered to be a formal submission once declared.
