              The annual electronic practice self declaration (eDEC) was first introduced to practices in April 2013 and has replaced the variable arrangements (such as the submission of annual reports) which existed between former Primary Care Trusts and providers of Primary Medical Services. The eDEC is an annual mandatory data collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information collected in the eDEC is covered in 8 categories, these include: 1. Practice Details, 2. Practice Staff, 3. Practice Premises and equipment, 4. Practice services, 5. Information about the practice and its procedures, 6. Governance, 7. Compliance with CQC. 8 GP I.T.
            </p>
            <p>
              To meet the Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration requirements, all services regulated by CQC must comply with the law, but in particular, they must comply with the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 (Part 3) (as amended). A number of the questions asked in this declaration therefore relate to CQCâ€™s registration requirements. In addition however this version of the declaration has been amended to reflect our commitment in the General Practice Forward View to reducing workload in regulatory duplication. The CQC has reviewed the questions such that responses will form part of their pre-inspection documentation thereby reducing workload for practices.
